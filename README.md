# Introduction 
## Aim of the project: 
This project aims to explore the following concepts:
- Functions as Objects 
-	Event Handling 
-	Lambda expressions 

These concepts will be explored through the creation of a 2D slider puzzle game that involves a GUI that displays tile movement, tile shuffling, button clicking, and conditioning. This project involves two languages: Python and Java which will both be handled by India Vella and Nirvana Mangion. 

In the end, the performance of both languages will be compared and analyzed to see which language is more efficient for a 2D slider puzzle game.
