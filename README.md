# Introduction 
## Aim of the project: 
This project aims to explore the following concepts:
- Functions as Objects 
-	Event Handling 
-	Lambda expressions 

These concepts will be explored through the creation of a 2D slider puzzle game that involves a GUI that displays tile movement, tile shuffling, button clicking, and conditioning. This project involves two languages: Python and Java which will both be handled by India Vella and Nirvana Mangion. 

In the end, the performance of both languages will be compared and analyzed to see which language is more efficient for a 2D slider puzzle game. 

# Team
The people behind this project are:

- India Vella
- Nirvana Mangion

All work was done together, meaning all code was written together.

# How to run

## Programming Language: Python
Make sure Python version: Python 3.12(64-bit) is installed


IDE being used: Visual Studio Code


After downloading Visual Studio Code make sure to install these 6 extensions before running the code: 
- Code Runner
- Pygame Snippets 
- Pylance 
- Python 
- Python Resource Monitor
- Tkinter

The code should run normally if these 5 extensions are installed.

### Installing Pygame
If pygame is not working even though the extension has been downloaded, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt and check if python and pip are installed
   - To check Python: python --version or python3 --version
   - To check pip: pip --version or pip3 --version
     

2. install pygame:
```python
pip3 install pygame
```



### Note
When opening the code, you might encounter a 'problem' with the Button indentation in grid.py. This is a problem with Visual Studio code and not the code itself. If you encounter this issue please move the line of code and return it to its original indentation until the 'problem' is resolved.

```Python
 self.shuffle_button = Button(self, (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0), BACKGROUND_WIDTH - 220, 20, 150, 50, "Shuffle", shuffle_button_action)
```

## Programming Language: Java
Make sure Intellij version: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2023.3.2 is installed


IDE being used: Intellij IDEA Community Edition 2023


After Downloading Intellij make sure you download the Java Development Kit (JDK).
Before adding the code to intellij, It's important to make sure that you've created a package called "SliderPuzzle".
You can do this by:
1. Right-clicking on the src file.
2. Go to new
3. Click on Package and input the name SliderPuzzle
4. After doing so, place the files (found in Java.md) in the package.

Once these are done, the code should run normally.
